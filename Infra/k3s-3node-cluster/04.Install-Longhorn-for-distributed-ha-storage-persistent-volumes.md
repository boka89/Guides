# This guide will help you to install Longhorn using helm charts, to easily manage distributed ha persistent volumes on your kubernetes cluster

## Download the environment check sript and run it for testing your kubernetes environment

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/refs/tags/v1.7.2/scripts/environment_check.sh
chmod +x environment_check.sh

./environment_check.sh 
```

## To fix all of the issues which were present using a 3 node k3s cluster with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS follow below steps

### Install nfs-common on all your nodes
``` sudo apt install nfs-common ```

### Enable iscsi deamon

```
sudo apt install open-isci
sudo modprobe iscsi_tcp
sudo systemctl enable iscsid
```

### Disable multipathd
```
systemctl stop multipathd
systemctl disable multipathd
```

## You can run the test script again, which should not have any issues

## Add the lonhorn repo to your k3s cluster
``` helm repo add longhorn https://charts.longhorn.io ```
## Install longhorn using the helm chart
``` helm install longhorn longhorn/longhorn --namespace longhorn-system --create-namespace --version 1.7.2 ```
## If you are having issues connecting to you cluster (Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: Kubernetes cluster unreachable: Get "http://localhost:8080/version": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused), just apply the below fix:
``` export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ```
## Once lonhorn was successfully deployed on your k3s cluster, create an ingress route using Traefik and CertManager with the below code
```
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: longhorn-ui
  namespace: longhorn-system
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - websecure
  routes:
    - kind: Rule
      match: Host(`longhorn.k3s.bokors.net`)
      services:
        - name: longhorn-frontend
          port: 80
  tls:
    secretName: longhorn-k3s-bokors-net-tls
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: longhorn-cert
spec:
  secretName: longhorn-k3s-bokors-net-tls
  renewBefore: 240h
  dnsNames:
  - 'longhorn.k3s.bokors.net'
  issuerRef:
    name: cloudflare-clusterissuer
    kind: ClusterIssuer
```
## After this point you will be able to login to longhorn WebUI
